                The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines access to the Adj-RIB-In
                and locally originated routes (e.g. routes distributed into BGP from
                protocols such as static) but not access to the BGP instance Loc-RIB.
                This document updates the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) RFC 7854 by
                adding access to the BGP instance Local-RIB, as defined in RFC 4271
                the routes that have been selected by the local BGP speaker's
                Decision Process. These are the routes over all peers, locally
                originated, and after best-path selection.

		This document defines a mechanism to monitor the BGP Local-RIB state
		for multiple BGP instances without the need for one or more unneeded
		BGP peering sessions. 

                The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) suggests that locally originated
                routes are locally sourced routes, such as redistributed or otherwise
                added routes to the BGP instance by the local router. It does not
                specify routes that are in the BGP instance Loc-RIB, such as routes
                after best-path selection.

            <t>
                The following are some use-cases for Loc-RIB access:
            </t>

            <t>
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>
                        Adj-RIBs-In Post-Policy may still contain hundreds of thousands
                        of routes per-peer but only a handful are selected and
                        installed in the Loc-RIB as part of the best-path selection.
                        Some monitoring applications, such as ones that need only to
                        correlate flow records to Loc-RIB entries, only need to collect
                        and monitor the routes that are actually selected and used.

                        <vspace blankLines="1"/>

                        Requiring the applications to collect all Adj-RIB-In Post-Policy
                        data forces the applications to receive a potentially
                        large unwanted data set and to perform the BGP decision process
                        selection, which includes having access to the IGP next-hop
                        metrics. While it is possible to obtain the IGP topology
                        information using BGP-LS, it requires the application to
                        implement SPF and possibly CSPF based on additional policies.
                        This is overly complex for such a simple application that only
                        needed to have access to the Loc-RIB.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        It is common to see frequent changes over many BGP peers, but
                        those changes do not always result in the router's Loc-RIB
                        changing. The change in the Loc-RIB can have a direct impact
                        on the forwarding state. It can greatly reduce time to
                        troubleshoot and resolve issues if operators had the history of
                        Loc-RIB changes. For example, a performance issue might have
                        been seen for only a duration of 5 minutes. Post
                        troubleshooting this issue without Loc-RIB history hides any
                        decision based routing changes that might have happened during
                        those five minutes.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Operators may wish to validate the impact of policies applied
                        to Adj-RIB-In by analyzing the final decision made by the
                        router when installing into the Loc-RIB. For example, in order
                        to validate if multi-path prefixes are installed as expected
                        for all advertising peers, the Adj-RIB-In Post-Policy and Loc-RIB
                        needs to be compared. This is only possible if the Loc-RIB
                        is available. Monitoring the Adj-RIB-In for this router from
                        another router to derive the Loc-RIB is likely to not show same
                        installed prefixes. For example, the received Adj-RIB-In will
                        be different if add-paths is not enabled or if maximum number
                        of equal paths are different from Loc-RIB to routes
                        advertised.
                    </t>
                </list>
            </t>

            <t>
                This document adds Loc-RIB to the BGP Monitoring Protocol and
                replaces <xref target="RFC7854">Section 8.2 of</xref> Locally Originated Routes.

            <section title="Current Method to Monitor Loc-RIB">
                <t>
                    Loc-RIB is used to build Adj-RIB-Out when advertising routes to a
                    peer. It is therefore possible to derive the Loc-RIB of a router by
                    monitoring the Adj-RIB-In Pre-Policy from another router.  At scale
                    this becomes overly complex and error prone.

                    The setup needed to monitor the Loc-RIB of a router requires another
                    router with a peering session to the target router that is to be
                    monitored. As shown in <xref target="FigCurLocRibMon"/>, the
                    target router Loc-RIB is advertised via Adj-RIB-Out
                    to the BMP router over a standard BGP peering session. The BMP
                    router then forwards Adj-RIB-In Pre-Policy to the BMP receiver.

                            when multiple BMP routers may have peering sessions to the same
                            router. The BMP receiver user is left with the error prone task of
                            identifying which peering session is the best representative of
                            the Loc-RIB.

                            BGP peering is designed to work between administrative domains
                            and therefore does not need to include internal system level
                            information of each peering router (e.g. the system name or
                            version information). In order to derive a Loc-RIB to a router,
                            the router name or other system information is needed. The BMP
                            receiver and user are forced to do some type of correlation using
                            what information is available in the peering session (e.g. peering
                            addresses, ASNs, and BGP-IDs). This leads to error prone
                            correlations.

                            The BGP-IDs and session addresses to router correlation
                            requires additional data, such as router inventory. This
                            additional data provides the BMP receiver the ability to map and
                            correlate the BGP-IDs and/or session addresses, but requires the
                            BMP receiver to somehow obtain this data outside of BMP. How this
                            data is obtained and the accuracy of the data directly effects the
                            integrity of the correlation.

                        <vspace blankLines="1"/>

                        For example, prefix 10.0.0.0/8 is updated in the Loc-RIB 5 times
                        within 1 second. State compression of BMP route monitor messages
                        results in only the final change being transmitted. The other 4
                        changes are suppressed because they fall within the compression
                        interval. If no compression was being used, all 5 updates would
                        have been transmitted.

                        <vspace blankLines="1"/>

                        A BMP receiver should expect that Loc-RIB route monitoring granularity
                        can be different by BMP sender implementation.

        <section title="Other Considerations">
            <section title="Loc-RIB Implementation">
                <t>
                    There are several methods to implement Loc-RIB efficiently.  In all
                    methods, the implementation emulates a peer with Peer UP and DOWN
                    messages to convey capabilities as well as Route Monitor messages to
                    convey Loc-RIB.  In this sense, the peer that conveys the Loc-RIB is
                    a local router emulated peer.
                </t>

                <section title="Multiple Loc-RIB Peers">
                    <t>
                        There MUST be multiple emulated peers for each Loc-RIB instance, such
                        as with VRFs. The BMP receiver identifies the Loc-RIB by the peer
                        header distinguisher and BGP ID.  The BMP receiver uses the VRF/Table
                        Name from the PEER UP information to associate a name to the Loc-RIB.

                        <vspace blankLines="1"/>

                        In some implementations, it might be required to have more than one
                        emulated peer for Loc-RIB to convey different address families for
                        the same Loc-RIB.  In this case, the peer distinguisher and BGP ID
                        should be the same since it represents the same Loc-RIB instance.
                        Each emulated peer instance MUST send a PEER UP with the OPEN message
                        indicating the address family capabilities.  A BMP receiver MUST
                        process these capabilities to know which peer belongs to which
                        address family.

                <section title="Filtering Loc-RIB to BMP Receivers">
                    <t>
                        There maybe be use-cases where BMP receivers should only receive
                        specific routes from Loc-RIB. For example, IPv4 unicast routes may
                        include IBGP, EBGP, and IGP but only routes from EBGP should be sent
                        to the BMP receiver.  Alternatively, it may be that only IBGP and
                        EBGP that should be sent and IGP redistributed routes should be
                        excluded.  In these cases where the Loc-RIB is filtered, the F flag
                        is set to 1 to indicate to the BMP receiver that the Loc-RIB is
                        filtered. If multiple filters are associated to the same Loc-RIB,
			a Table Name MUST be used in order to allow a BMP receiver to make
			the right associations.

                <section title="Changes to existing BMP sessions">
                    <t>
			In case of any change that results in the alteration of behaviour of
			an existing BMP session, ie. changes to filtering and table names, the
			session MUST be bounced with a Peer DOWN/Peer UP sequence.
