                The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines access to various Routing
                Information Bases (RIBs). This document updates BMP (RFC 7854) by
                adding access to the Local Routing Information Base (Loc-RIB), as
                defined in RFC 4271. The Loc-RIB contains the routes that have been
                selected by the local BGP speaker's Decision Process.

                This document defines a mechanism to monitor the BGP Loc-RIB state
                of remote BGP instances without the need to establish BGP peering
                sessions.

                BMP <xref target="RFC7854" format="default"/> does not define a method to send
                the BGP instance Loc-RIB.  It does define in 
                <xref target="RFC7854" format="default">section 8.2 of</xref> locally originated routes,
                but these routes are defined as the routes originated into BGP. For
                example, locally sourced routes that are redistributed.

                The following are some use-cases for Loc-RIB access:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
            <t>
                        The Adj-RIB-In for a given peer Post-Policy may contain hundreds of
                        thousands of routes, with only a handful of routes selected and installed
                        in the Loc-RIB after best-path selection.
                        Some monitoring applications, such as ones that need only to
                        correlate flow records to Loc-RIB entries, only need to collect
                        and monitor the routes that are actually selected and used.

            </t>
            <t>

                        Requiring the applications to collect all Adj-RIB-In Post-Policy
                        data forces the applications to receive a potentially
                        large unwanted data set and to perform the BGP decision process
                        selection, which includes having access to the IGP next-hop
                        metrics. While it is possible to obtain the IGP topology
                        information using BGP-LS, it requires the application to
                        implement SPF and possibly CSPF based on additional policies.
                        This is overly complex for such a simple application that only
                        needed to have access to the Loc-RIB.
            </t>                        

        </li>
        <li>
                        It is common to see frequent changes over many BGP peers, but
                        those changes do not always result in the router's Loc-RIB
                        changing. The change in the Loc-RIB can have a direct impact
                        on the forwarding state. It can greatly reduce time to
                        troubleshoot and resolve issues if operators had the history of
                        Loc-RIB changes. For example, a performance issue might have
                        been seen for only a duration of 5 minutes. Post
                        troubleshooting this issue without Loc-RIB history hides any
                        decision based routing changes that might have happened during
                        those five minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
                        Operators may wish to validate the impact of policies applied
                        to Adj-RIB-In by analyzing the final decision made by the
                        router when installing into the Loc-RIB. For example, in order
                        to validate if multi-path prefixes are installed as expected
                        for all advertising peers, the Adj-RIB-In Post-Policy and Loc-RIB
                        needs to be compared. This is only possible if the Loc-RIB
                        is available. Monitoring the Adj-RIB-In for this router from
                        another router to derive the Loc-RIB is likely to not show same
                        installed prefixes. For example, the received Adj-RIB-In will
                        be different if add-paths is not enabled or if maximum number
                        of equal paths are different from Loc-RIB to routes
                        advertised.
      </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
                This document adds Loc-RIB to the BGP Monitoring Protocol and
                replaces <xref target="RFC7854" format="default">Section 8.2 of</xref> Locally Originated Routes.

        <t>
                    Loc-RIB is used to build Adj-RIB-Out when advertising routes to a
                    peer. It is therefore possible to derive the Loc-RIB of a router by
                    monitoring the Adj-RIB-In Pre-Policy from another router.  At scale
                    this becomes overly complex and error prone.

                    The setup needed to monitor the Loc-RIB of a router requires another
                    router with a peering session to the target router that is to be
                    monitored. As shown in <xref target="FigCurLocRibMon" format="default"/>, the
                    target router Loc-RIB is advertised via Adj-RIB-Out
                    to the BMP router over a standard BGP peering session. The BMP
                    router then forwards Adj-RIB-In Pre-Policy to the BMP receiver.
        </t>
        <t>
                    The current method introduces the need for additional resources:

        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
                    Requires at least two routers when only one router was to be
                    monitored.
          </li>
          <li>
                    Requires additional BGP peering to collect the received updates
                    when peering may have not even been required in the first
                    place. For example, VRFs with no peers, redistributed BGP-LS
                    with no peers, segment routing egress peer engineering where no
                    peers have link-state address family enabled.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
                    Complexities introduced with current method in order to derive
                    (e.g. correlate) peer to router Loc-RIB:

        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
                    Adj-RIB-Out received as Adj-RIB-In from another router may have
                    a policy applied that filters, generates aggregates, suppresses
                    more specifics, manipulates attributes, or filters routes. Not
                    only does this invalidate the Loc-RIB view, it adds complexity
                    when multiple BMP routers may have peering sessions to the same
                    router. The BMP receiver user is left with the error prone task of
                    identifying which peering session is the best representative of
                    the Loc-RIB.
          </li>
          <li>
                    BGP peering is designed to work between administrative domains
                    and therefore does not need to include internal system level
                    information of each peering router (e.g. the system name or
                    version information). In order to derive a Loc-RIB to a router,
                    the router name or other system information is needed. The BMP
                    receiver and user are forced to do some type of correlation using
                    what information is available in the peering session (e.g. peering
                    addresses, ASNs, and BGP-IDs). This leads to error prone
                    correlations.
          </li>
          <li>
                    The BGP-IDs and session addresses to router correlation
                    requires additional data, such as router inventory. This
                    additional data provides the BMP receiver the ability to map and
                    correlate the BGP-IDs and/or session addresses, but requires the
                    BMP receiver to somehow obtain this data outside of BMP. How this
                    data is obtained and the accuracy of the data directly effects the
                    integrity of the correlation.

            State compression and throttling SHOULD be used by a BMP sender

            For example, prefix 10.0.0.0/8 is updated in the Loc-RIB 5 times
            within 1 second. State compression of BMP route monitor messages
            results in only the final change being transmitted. The other 4
            changes are suppressed because they fall within the compression

        <t>
            There are several methods for a BGP speaker to implement Loc-RIB efficiently.
            In all methods, the implementation emulates a peer with Peer UP and DOWN
            messages to convey capabilities as well as Route Monitor messages to
            convey Loc-RIB.  In this sense, the peer that conveys the Loc-RIB is
            a local router emulated peer.

          <name>Multiple Loc-RIB Peers</name>
          <t>
            There MUST be multiple emulated peers for each Loc-RIB instance, such
            as with VRFs. The BMP receiver identifies the Loc-RIB by the peer
            header distinguisher and BGP ID.  The BMP receiver uses the VRF/Table
            Name from the PEER UP information to associate a name to the Loc-RIB.
          </t>
          <t>
            In some implementations, it might be required to have more than one
            emulated peer for Loc-RIB to convey different address families for
            the same Loc-RIB.  In this case, the peer distinguisher and BGP ID
            should be the same since it represents the same Loc-RIB instance.
            Each emulated peer instance MUST send a PEER UP with the OPEN message
            indicating the address family capabilities.  A BMP receiver MUST
            process these capabilities to know which peer belongs to which
            address family.

          <name>Filtering Loc-RIB to BMP Receivers</name>
          <t>
            There maybe be use-cases where BMP receivers should only receive
            specific routes from Loc-RIB. For example, IPv4 unicast routes may
            include IBGP, EBGP, and IGP but only routes from EBGP should be sent
            to the BMP receiver.  Alternatively, it may be that only IBGP and
            EBGP that should be sent and IGP redistributed routes should be
            excluded.  In these cases where the Loc-RIB is filtered, the F flag
            is set to 1 to indicate to the BMP receiver that the Loc-RIB is
            filtered. If multiple filters are associated to the same Loc-RIB,
			a Table Name MUST be used in order to allow a BMP receiver to make

            <t>In many standards track documents several words are used to signify the requirements in the specification.  These words are often capitalized. This document defines these words as they should be interpreted in IETF documents.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t>

            <t>This document discusses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is an inter-Autonomous System routing protocol.</t>
            <t>The primary function of a BGP speaking system is to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems.  This network reachability information includes information on the list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that reachability information traverses. This information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability from which routing loops may be pruned, and, at the AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced.</t>
            <t>BGP-4 provides a set of mechanisms for supporting Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR).  These mechanisms include support for advertising a set of destinations as an IP prefix, and eliminating the concept of network "class" within BGP.  BGP-4 also introduces mechanisms that allow aggregation of routes, including aggregation of AS paths.</t>

            <t>This document defines the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP), which can be used to monitor BGP sessions.  BMP is intended to provide a convenient interface for obtaining route views.  Prior to the introduction of BMP, screen scraping was the most commonly used approach to obtaining such views.  The design goals are to keep BMP simple, useful, easily implemented, and minimally service affecting. BMP is not suitable for use as a routing protocol.</t>
